So I am looking for anything to do with multipart
anything i find sus i note with 'JOSE'
Nothing in main.go
Possibly reference partSize() in file.go

Under func newGoofys(ctx context.Context, bucket string, flags *FlagStorage, newBackend in goofys.go it goes to backend.go via storagebackend
Though i dont feel like theres anything in backend.go that does it for me?

How about this, NoParallelMultipart in backend.go?
of course also partSize in file.go

you know what let's just commit and see what the heck we can do its getting hard to track for my smol brain
